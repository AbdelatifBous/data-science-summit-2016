This repository was created for people who will attend the [Data Science Summit](http://conf.dato.com/2016/emea/) tutorial. This tutorial is based on OpenCV version 3.1.0.

To install OpenCVP please follow the instructions in the markdown file "Installation Steps for OpenCV 3.1.0"

# Face Recognition with OpenCV and TensorFlow

- Author: Rodrigo Agundez from Qualogy
- Place: Jerusalem, International Convention Center
- Date: Sunday, June 5, 2016
- Time: 10:00
- Room: 1

The goal of this tutorial is to build a simple face recognition system with the use of the opencv library. This tutorial is separated in four parts:

- Manipulation of images and videos using OpenCV.
- Face Detection and Buildig the dataset
- Building the recognition model
- Recognize faces in a live video feed

### A bit about OpenCV
OpenCV is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
The library includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to:
<div style="float: left; width: 40%; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px">
<ul style="align: left; list-style-type:square">
  <li>Detect Faces</li>
  <li>Recognize Faces</li>
  <li>Identify Objects</li>
  <li>Classify human actions in videos</li>
  <li>Track camera movement</li>
  <li>Track moving objects</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 60%; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px">
<ul style="align: left; list-style-type:square">
  <li>Extract 3D models of objects</li>
  <li>Produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras</li>
  <li>Stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene</li>
  <li>Find similar images from an image database</li>
  <li>Remove red eyes from images taken using flash</li>
  <li>Follow eye movements</li>
</ul>
</div>

It has C++, C, Python, Java and MATLAB interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Android and Mac OS.
